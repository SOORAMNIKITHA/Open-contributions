Deep Learning Project – Face Recognition with Python & OpenCV
Face Recognition with Python – Identify and recognize a person in the live real-time video.

In this deep learning project, we will learn how to recognize the human faces in live video with Python. We will build this project using python dlib’s facial recognition network. Dlib is a general-purpose software library. Using dlib toolkit, we can make real-world machine learning applications.

In this project, we will first understand the working of face recognizer. Then we will build face recognition with Python.

This deep learning project teaches you how to develop human face recognition project with python libraries dlib and face_recognition APIs (of OpenCV).

It also covers the introduction to face_recognition API. We have implemented this python project in two parts:


In the first part, we have seen how to store the information about human face structure, i.e face embedding. Then we learn how to store these embeddings.
In the second part, we have seen how to recognize the person by comparing the new face embeddings with the stored one.
